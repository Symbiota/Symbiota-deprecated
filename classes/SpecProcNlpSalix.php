/* This class extends the SpecProcNlp class and thus inherits all public and protected variables and functions 
 * The general idea is to that the SpecProcNlp class will cover all shared Symbiota functions (e.g. batch processor, resolve state, resolve collector, test output, etc)
 */ 
/* The general approach of the algorithm is as follows:
	The label is pre-formatted and separated into lines, broken both at existing newlines and also at some semi-colons and periods.
	Some separated lines are re-joined if the previous one ends in words such as by, at, on, etc.
	Each field is processed one at a time, starting with Latitude/Longitude.  Order matters.
	For each field (in general): 
		Lines are evaluated, ranked and sorted for probability of containing that field.
		Relevant content is focused on in the most probable line(s) (using various techniques), extracted and added to the Results array
		Content that was extracted is generally deleted from the line so that other fields won't mistakenly grab it.
