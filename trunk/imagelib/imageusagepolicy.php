        <H3>NOTE ON HERBARIUM SPECIMENS: </h3>
        <p>Herbarium specimens are used for scientific studies of plants 
        and because of skilled preparation and careful use they may last for hundreds of years.  
        In our herbarium we have specimens of plants collected in Tempe 100 years ago that are no longer
        found here and are thus vouchers of a vegetation that has now disappeared.  
        We expect the specimens in our herbarium to be available for future generations.  
        By making some of our herbarium specimens available on the web as images we not only 
        increase their availability but we also reduce the inadvertent damage caused by use.   
        If you are considering making specimens, remember collecting normally requires permission 
        of the landowner and, in the case of rare and endangered plants, additional permits may 
        be required.</p>
