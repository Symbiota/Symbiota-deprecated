When creating a new schema patch after 0.9.1.12, include in 
it a line in the form:

INSERT INTO schemaversion (versionnumber) values ('0.9.1.13');

This will allow easy determination by both DBAs and the codebase
of whether or not a particular patch has been applied to a 
particular symbiota installation.
