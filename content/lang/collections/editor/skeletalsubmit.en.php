Since collections are commonly organized by scientific name, country, and state, it takes little extra effort for imaging teams to collect this information while they are imaging specimens. The imaging team enters the basic collection information shared by the batch of specimens being processed, and then each time they scan a barcode into the catalog number field, a record is added to the system primed with the catalog number and skeletal data.';

An image can also be uploaded by clicking on the image symbol to the right of the catalog number, but images typically need to be adjusted before they are ready for upload (e.g. resized, light balanced). Furthermore, projects that store their images on remote image servers will typically require separate workflows for batch processing images. Contact your project / portal manager to find out the preferred way to load specimen images.';

Skeletal data will not copy over existing field values.';
